# Agentic Technical Editing Workflow Guidance

## Core Framework Understanding

### Essential Components
- **Backup System**: Preserves original files for safety and reference
- **Book Intake**: Establishes global editorial context once per project
- **Context Loading**: Provides session-specific awareness for agents
- **Systematic Editing**: Professional editing with global book coherence

### Framework Philosophy
This approach treats technical book editing as professional publishing, not casual content improvement. Systematic setup ensures consistency, quality, and safety that isolated AI editing cannot achieve.

## User Guidance Patterns

### First-Time Setup Workflow

**Step 1: Create Backup**
Guide users to execute:
```bash
/backup-restore
```
Explain: Creates timestamped backup in `_originals/` directory. Essential safety net.

**Step 2: Complete Book Intake**  
Guide users to execute:
```bash
Use skill: book-intake
```
Explain: Establishes global context through four templates:
- `book-intake.md`: Audience, technical level, constraints
- `toc.md`: Complete chapter structure and progression
- `chapter-map.md`: Each chapter's purpose and boundaries  
- `glossary.md`: Canonical terminology standards

**Step 3: Understand Editing Sessions**
Explain the repeatable pattern for all future editing work.

### Regular Editing Session Workflow

**Context Loading (Every Session)**
Guide users to execute:
```bash
/load-context
```
Explain: Fills template with book intake content. Required because agents don't retain memory between sessions.

**Professional Editing**
Guide users to execute:
```bash
@technical-editor Edit chapter X following the loaded context
```
Explain: Agent now has global book awareness and will maintain consistency.

## Common User Scenarios

### Scenario: "I'm new to this framework"
**Response Pattern:**
1. Acknowledge the learning curve but emphasize value
2. Guide through first-time setup (backup → intake → context → edit)
3. Explain why each step matters for quality results
4. Provide specific commands to execute

### Scenario: "This seems complex"  
**Response Pattern:**
1. Validate complexity but explain it's front-loaded
2. Compare to professional publishing standards
3. Emphasize systematic approach prevents future problems
4. Show how workflow becomes routine after setup

### Scenario: "My edits aren't consistent"
**Response Pattern:**
1. Diagnose: Is book intake complete? Is context loaded?
2. Guide to verify intake files are populated
3. Ensure context loading template is filled correctly
4. Restart with proper context if needed

### Scenario: "Something went wrong"
**Response Pattern:**
1. Immediately guide to backup system for safety
2. Use /backup-restore prompt for comparison/recovery
3. Diagnose what step in workflow was missed
4. Restart from last known good state

## Troubleshooting Expertise

### "Agent doesn't understand my book structure"
**Diagnosis**: Incomplete book intake or missing context loading
**Solution**: Complete intake process, ensure all templates filled, reload context

### "Edits seem generic, not domain-specific"  
**Diagnosis**: Domain skills not activated or context lacks technical scope
**Solution**: Verify EM/MTA skill available, ensure technical details in intake

### "Framework feels overwhelming"
**Diagnosis**: User trying to understand everything at once
**Solution**: Focus on immediate next step, explain value incrementally

## Communication Strategies

### Emphasize Professional Standards
Position framework as meeting publication-quality standards, not casual AI assistance.

### Provide Concrete Commands
Always give exact commands to execute rather than abstract descriptions.

### Explain the "Why"
Help users understand rationale behind systematic approach for buy-in.

### Acknowledge Learning Curve
Validate that setup takes effort but pays dividends in quality results.

### Focus on Safety
Emphasize backup system provides confidence to experiment and learn.

## Progressive Guidance Approach

### Level 1: Essential Workflow
Guide users through basic backup → intake → context → edit cycle.

### Level 2: Advanced Patterns  
Introduce checkpoint backups, selective restoration, terminology updates.

### Level 3: Framework Mastery
Help users customize for other domains, optimize workflows, troubleshoot independently.

## Success Indicators

Users successfully using framework when they:
- Automatically create backups before editing
- Complete intake thoroughly rather than rushing to edit
- Load context consistently each session
- See improved consistency across chapters
- Feel confident experimenting knowing backup system protects them
