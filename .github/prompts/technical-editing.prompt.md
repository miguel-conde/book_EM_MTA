# Task: Professional Technical Editing

## Precondition — Global Context

Assume you have visibility of the full book structure (table of contents) and
understand the role of this chapter within the overall narrative.

Your edits must be consistent with:
- Earlier chapters
- Later chapters
- Overall conceptual progression

---

## Input
You will receive a chapter or section from a technical book (likely Quarto-based).

The content:
- Is technically complete and substantively correct
- Was originally written in a chat-like, informal style
- May contain emojis, conversational artifacts, or chat formatting
- May serve multiple audiences (technical experts, business stakeholders, students)
- Contains mathematical notation, code examples, or technical diagrams

---

## Objective
Edit the content so it matches the standards of a **professionally written
technical book or high-quality online course**, while maintaining full coherence
with the rest of the book.

---

## Editorial Guidelines

### Content Preservation
1. Preserve the original language(s) exactly.
2. Preserve the content 100% - no additions or removals.
3. Preserve all mathematical formulations, code blocks, and technical examples.

### Style Transformation
4. Remove emojis, conversational artifacts, and chat-style formatting.
5. Transform to professional, didactic technical prose.
6. Maintain appropriate depth for the intended audience(s).

### Structure and Clarity
7. Restructure paragraphs or sections if it improves logical flow.
8. Expand compressed explanations using only existing ideas.
9. Ensure smooth transitions between technical concepts.

### Technical Standards
10. Maintain consistent mathematical notation throughout.
11. Verify alignment between prose explanations and technical content.
12. Preserve established terminology and technical distinctions.
13. Ensure consistency with the book's global structure and progression.

## Constraints

### Absolute Prohibitions
- Do NOT add or remove content, concepts, or examples.
- Do NOT introduce new ideas, arguments, or technical material.
- Do NOT summarize unless explicitly requested.
- Do NOT change mathematical formulations or code implementations.

### Technical Preservation
- Preserve all Quarto-compatible Markdown syntax.
- Maintain mathematical notation consistency (LaTeX formatting).
- Keep cross-references, citations, and internal links intact.
- Preserve code block formatting and computational examples.

### Domain Considerations
- Reference available skills for domain-specific terminology and conventions.
- Apply field-specific standards while maintaining editorial principles.
- When in doubt about technical accuracy, preserve the original formulation.

## Output
Return the fully edited content that:

- Reads as professionally written technical prose
- Maintains full technical accuracy and consistency
- Is ready for direct inclusion in the publication
- Preserves all mathematical, computational, and cross-reference elements
- Flows logically within the book's overall narrative structure
- Serves all intended audiences without sacrificing technical rigor
