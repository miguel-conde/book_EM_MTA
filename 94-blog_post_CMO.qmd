# Blog post (CMO) — Why Multitouch Attribution Fails — and How to Fix It Without Losing Incrementality

*Audience: Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) and senior marketing leadership.*

*By design, Multitouch Attribution promises clarity.
In practice, it often delivers confusion.*

For years, marketing leaders have been told that Multitouch Attribution (MTA) would finally explain *what really drives performance*. Yet many organizations still struggle to trust their attribution results—or, worse, make decisions that later prove misleading.

The issue is not that MTA is useless. The issue is that **MTA is often asked to solve the wrong problem**.

## **The core tension: granularity vs truth**

CMOs face two different needs:

1. **Strategic truth**

   * How much impact does marketing truly generate?
   * Which channels are incrementally effective?

2. **Executional clarity**

   * Which campaigns work better?
   * Which creatives should be scaled or paused?

Most attribution debates arise when these two needs get mixed.

## **Why traditional MTA often disappoints**

Classic MTA approaches typically:

* operate at user or touchpoint level
* allocate credit based on observed journeys
* assume exposure equals influence

The underlying problem is simple:

> **Exposure is not causation.**

A campaign that appears frequently in conversion paths is not necessarily incremental. It may simply be well-targeted, always-on, or correlated with demand.

This is why organizations relying solely on MTA often:

* over-invest in lower-funnel tactics
* penalize upper-funnel activity
* see performance collapse when budgets shift

## **Where Marketing Mix Models (MMM) change the picture**

Marketing Mix Models (MMM) solve a different—and crucial—problem.

MMM answers:

* *How much impact did each channel generate incrementally?*
* *What would have happened without this spend?*

In other words:

> **MMM provides causal grounding at the channel level.**

But MMM alone is not enough. It tells you *where to invest*, not *how to execute inside the channel*.

---

## **The missing link: connecting MMM and MTA**

The real opportunity is not choosing between MMM and MTA, but **connecting them properly**.

A robust measurement framework follows a simple logic:

1. **MMM establishes the incremental truth**
   Channel-level impact is estimated using causal, counterfactual methods.

2. **MTA distributes that truth internally**
   Campaigns and creatives receive credit *only within the incremental total already validated by MMM*.

This avoids the most common attribution failure:

> inventing performance that does not exist.

## **MTA as a credit allocation problem**

Seen this way, MTA is not a prediction problem.
It is a **credit allocation problem**.

* We observe a total (incremental impact from MMM)
* We observe delivery patterns (impressions, timing, geography)
* We allocate credit internally, without changing the total

This reframing matters because it:

* enforces discipline
* preserves financial consistency
* aligns analytics with business reality

## **Why Expectation–Maximization (EM) fits naturally**

Expectation–Maximization is a well-established statistical approach designed exactly for this situation:

* part of the data is observed
* part is latent
* totals must be conserved

In an MMM-connected MTA setup, EM ensures that:

* no revenue or conversions are created or destroyed
* attribution remains stable over time
* assumptions are explicit and auditable

For CMOs, the key takeaway is simple:

> **EM does not change what marketing achieved.
> It only explains how that achievement can be distributed internally.**

## **What this approach does—and does not—claim**

### What it *does*

* Enables reliable intra-channel optimization
* Supports creative and campaign prioritization
* Aligns analytics, finance, and marketing around a single source of truth

### What it *does not*

* Claim causality at the creative level
* Replace experimentation
* Eliminate the need for judgment

This distinction is essential for governance and credibility.

## **A more mature view of attribution**

The most advanced organizations no longer ask:

> “Which attribution model is best?”

They ask:

> “Which measurement problem are we trying to solve?”

* **MMM** for strategic investment decisions
* **MTA (properly constrained)** for execution optimization
* **Experiments** to validate and learn

Each plays a different role.

---

## **The bottom line for CMOs**

Multitouch Attribution is not broken. It is often **misapplied**.

When grounded in MMM and treated as a disciplined credit allocation problem, MTA becomes:

* more trustworthy
* more stable
* more useful for real decisions

> **MMM decides where to invest.
> MTA helps you execute better—without losing the truth.**
